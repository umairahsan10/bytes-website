# üîó Automated Internal Linking System

This system automatically adds internal links to your blog posts based on keywords, saving you hours of manual work every week.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic Keyword Detection**: Scans blog content and adds relevant internal links
- **Smart Linking**: Only links the first occurrence of each keyword per paragraph
- **Related Posts**: Automatically shows related articles at the bottom of each post
- **Keyword Management**: Easy admin interface to manage keywords
- **Content Analysis**: Suggests new keywords based on your content
- **SEO Optimized**: Links are properly styled and accessible

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Internal Linking**
When someone visits a blog post, the system:
- Scans the content for predefined keywords
- Adds clickable links to relevant blog posts
- Only links the first occurrence per paragraph (prevents over-linking)
- Maintains natural reading flow

### 2. **Related Posts Section**
At the bottom of each blog post, you'll see:
- 3 related articles based on content similarity
- Clean, modern design with images and excerpts
- Automatic updates when you add new content

### 3. **Keyword Management**
Access the admin panel at `/admin/keywords` to:
- View all current keywords and their URLs
- Filter by category (SEO, Web Development, etc.)
- Analyze content for new keyword suggestions
- Export/import keyword mappings
- Monitor system statistics

## üìù How to Add New Keywords

### Option 1: Edit the Code (Recommended for developers)
1. Open `src/lib/internalLinking.ts`
2. Add new entries to the `keywordToUrlMap` object:

```typescript
export const keywordToUrlMap: Record<string, string> = {
  // Existing keywords...
  'your new keyword': '/blogs/your-blog-slug',
  'another keyword': '/blogs/another-blog-slug',
};
```

### Option 2: Use the Admin Interface
1. Visit `/admin/keywords` in your browser
2. Use the "Analyze Blog Content" button to get suggestions
3. Add new keywords through the interface (when implemented)

## üéØ Best Practices

### Keyword Selection
- **Be Specific**: Use longer, more specific keywords (e.g., "technical SEO" vs "SEO")
- **Match User Intent**: Choose keywords that users would actually search for
- **Avoid Over-Linking**: The system prevents this, but choose keywords wisely
- **Update Regularly**: Add keywords for new blog posts as you publish them

### Content Strategy
- **Natural Integration**: Keywords should fit naturally in your content
- **Relevance**: Only link to truly relevant articles
- **Quality**: Ensure linked articles provide value to readers
