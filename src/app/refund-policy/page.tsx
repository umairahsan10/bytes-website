          <h1>Refund &amp; Return Policy â€“ Bytes Platform</h1>
          
          <p>
            Bytes Platform is committed to delivering high-quality digital services through structured processes and transparent agreements. 
            This refund and return policy outlines the conditions under which refunds or cancellations may be considered.
          </p>

          <div className="border-t border-gray-200 my-8"></div>

          <h2>1. Contract-Specific Terms</h2>
          <p>
            Refunds, returns, and cancellations are primarily governed by the individual agreements or contracts signed with each client. 
            Any request for refunds must follow the conditions outlined in your specific service contract.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bytes Platform reserves the right to deny refunds where contractual terms are not met, or where substantial progress or delivery has been made.
          </p>

            <li>For SEO services, the 50% advance for the first month is non-refundable once the work has commenced.</li>
            <li>The remaining 50% is due upon completion of the month's deliverables, and becomes non-refundable once delivered.</li>
          </ul>
